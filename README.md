This is an Automation project using Java with Selenium Webdriver for UI Tests and REST Assured for API Tests.

The main features of this project has the following:

* Page Object Model (POM) as a design pattern for creating an Object directory for web UI elements.
* Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, tester used @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements.
* Interface to bind static constants and abstract methods to achieve Data Abstraction and multiple Inheritance.
* The re-usability of code to avoid unnecessary data exposure to the user by using the abstraction.
* TestNG is a framework for writing test automation tests.
* REST Assured is a framework for writing RESTful API tests.
* Selenium Webdriver is a webdriver that supports UI Tests.

### ‚ö°Ô∏èAutomation Test Strategy
This is an end-to-end UI tests using Selenium Webdriver and API tests using REST Assured.
The website under test was MercadoLibre e-commerce website [here](https://www.mercadolibre.com) with a BaseUrl to test different domain access according to the desired location. I must say it was fun learning and automating this website because it was challenging in some respects.

1. Browser is Microsoft Edge in order to have a different approach to test.
2. User will navigate to the website and select a category on the navigation menu and verify the total results on the page.
3. User will select a product and verify the product details.
4. End-to-end UI tests has the following scenarios:
    * Scenario 1:
        * Test to verify the "Air Condition" category workflow
    * Scenario 2:
        * Test to verify the "Smartphones" category workflow
    * Scenario 3:
        * Test to verify the "Fragrances" category workflow
    * Scenario 4:
        * Test to verify the "Tools" category workflow
    * Scenario 5:
        * Test to verify the "Baby" category workflow
    * Scenario 6:
        * Test to verify the Logo Page is displayed
    * Scenario 7:
        * Test to verify the Product Page with the product details
5. REST API tests has the following scenarios:
    * Scenario 1:
        * Test to get the product by name
        * Method GET to Search Product to verify API response
    * Scenario 2:
        * Test to get the product by id
        * Method GET to Product by id to verify API response
6. After the test, assertions will be validated to each test, user will check for the logo and select a product and verify the product details.
7. Annotation @Test will be used to group the tests by Smoke and Regression tests.
8. Each tests will finish automatically and the browser will be closed.

## ü§ø Pre-requisites:
1. Download the latest Java JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133155.html)
2. Install git from [here](https://git-scm.com)
3. Selenium Webdriver from [here](https://www.selenium.dev)
4. Get WebDriverManager from [here](https://bonigarcia.dev/webdrivermanager/)
5. Install Apache Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org)
6. Test Runner is TestNG 7 from [here](https://www.testng.org/downloads.html)
7. API REST Assured from [here](https://rest-assured.io/)
8. Build Tool is Maven the latest version
9. Note: ChromeDriver.exe is not necessary, you should use the WebDriverManager capabilities.
10. Note: POM.xml has all configuration installed, you should use the Maven build tool only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the project:
3. Set up Maven
   1. Run the following command in the terminal:
       * Option 1: `mvn clean`
       * Option 2: `mvn clean package`
4. Running Tests in the project
    * Option 1: run `mvn clean install` in the path of the project 
    * Option 2: Open the project baseline and run each Selenium Test and REST API tests
5. Enjoy the project! üòé
